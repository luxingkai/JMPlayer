     In this chapter you learn about the capabilities, architecture,
     and internal workings of audio queues. You get introduced to
     audio queues, audio queue buffers, and the callback functions
     that audio queues use for recording or playback. You also
     find out about audio queue states and parameters. By the end
     of this chapter you will have gained the conceptual
     understanding you need to use this technology effectively.
